   subtitle="Effortlessly Render Vector Graphics in .NET"
   subtext="Aspose.Drawing for .NET offers text rendering, vector graphics drawing, and image manipulation features for developers to integrate into .NET apps. It is a great replacement for the System.Drawing.Common package and enables end users to utilize the package features across multiple platforms effortlessly. Our API lets developers easily draw lines, arcs, curves, polygons, circles, rectangles, and more shapes. It also provides methods to manipulate and save images in JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP, and TIFF formats."
   subtext2="The .NET 2D graphics API supports bitmap loading and creation, rendering text with different font styles, using pens and brushes, and cropping and scaling images within the .NET vector graphic manipulation solutions. Developers can programmatically utilize advanced rendering capabilities such as clipping, alpha blending, and antialiasing with the help of our API. Aspose.Drawing for .NET packs easy-to-use functionality to develop new 2D graphics rendering, drawing, and image processing solutions or seamlessly upgrade the existing solutions."

<p>Drawing rectangle shapes using the 2D graphics library is pretty straightforward. Please refer to the following instructions and sample code for more information.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Instantiate an object of the <a href="https://apireference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/bitmap">Bitmap</a> class.</li>
   <li>Create a <strong>Brush</strong> and specify its color.</li>
   <li>Using the brush object, create a <a href="https://apireference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/pen">Pen</a>.</li>
   <li>Draw the rectangle.</li>
   <li>Save the output drawing file/image.</li>
</ul>
{{< products/product-feature-blocks-snip

// Initialize a Bitmap class object
Bitmap bitmap = new Bitmap(1000, 1000, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppPArgb);

// Create graphics class instance
Graphics graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap);

// Create a brush while specifying its color
Brush brush = new SolidBrush(Color.FromKnownColor(KnownColor.Blue));

// Create a pen
Pen pen = new Pen(brush);

// Draw rectangle
graphics.DrawRectangle(pen, 100, 100, 800, 600);

// Save output drawing
bitmap.Save("Rectangle.png");

<p>Develop specialized modules that provide bitmap creation functionality using our API. The coding example and information given below provide more insight.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Create a new bitmap using the <strong>Bitmap</strong> class.</li>
   <li>Create a new <a href="https://apireference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/graphics">Graphics</a> object from the Bitmap object.</li>
   <li>Initialize a <strong>Pen</strong> class object, and specify the color/size.</li>
   <li>Use the <strong>DrawEllipse</strong> method to draw an Ellipse.</li>
   <li>Save the output image using the <strong>Save</strong> method.</li>
   
</ul>

// This code example showcases creating a new bitmap programmatically in C#.
// Initialize the Bitmap object
Bitmap bitmap = new Bitmap(1000, 800, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppPArgb);

// Create a new Graphics
Graphics graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap);

// Initialize a pen
Pen pen = new Pen(Color.Red, 5);

// Draw a rectangle
graphics.DrawEllipse(pen, new Rectangle(0, 0, 700, 700));

// Save the file
bitmap.Save(@"C:\Files\Drawings\output.png");
