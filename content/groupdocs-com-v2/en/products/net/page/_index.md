<p>As part of the XPS document generation, manipulation, and processing capabilities of Aspose.Page for .NET API, inserting text into XPS files is a prominent feature. In the following C# code example, we will review how to add text to XPS files quickly and easily, so letâ€™s check the <a href="https://blog.aspose.com/page/insert-image-text-xps-csharp/#section1">steps involved</a>.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Create an <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/page/net/aspose.page.xps/xpsdocument">XPSDocument</a> class object.</li>
   <li>Next, create a brush of a color of your choice.</li>
   <li>Add a glyph to the file.</li>
   <li>Save the XPS document using the Save method.</li>
</ul>
{{< products/product-feature-blocks-snip

// Create a new XPS Document
XpsDocument doc = new XpsDocument();

// Create a brush 
XpsSolidColorBrush textFill = doc.CreateSolidColorBrush(Color.Black);

// Add glyph to the document
XpsGlyphs glyphs = doc.AddGlyphs("Arial", 12, FontStyle.Regular, 300f, 450f, "Hello World!");
glyphs.Fill = textFill;

// Save the resultant XPS document
doc.Save("AddText_out.xps");
