   subtitle="Powerful 3D Rendering Capabilities for .NET Apps"
   subtext="Aspose.3D for .NET is a full-featured 3D file format processing and manipulation API to programmatically create, render, edit, and convert 3D documents. It offers a complete 3D document format processing experience for .NET developers to efficiently manipulate the substance of different types of 3D files. The 3D API for .NET supports popular 3D file formats, including AutoDesk (FBX), STL, Wavefront (OBJ), Discreet 3D Studios (3DS), Universal3D (U3D), Collada (DAE), Google Draco (DRC), DirectX, DXF, 3MF, and more. Developers can access and work with various elements of the object model, such as scenes, mesh, node, property, vertex, polygonbuilder, box, torus, sphere, plane, cylinder, and more."
   subtext2="The .NET 3D API provides all the necessary tools for developers to upgrade their .NET apps by integrating 3D rendering and conversion capabilities. You can create and export 3D scenes, add animations, manage geometry and mesh, enhance cylinder creation, insert cameras into scenes, render 3D views as images, and do much more. The 3D file format conversion API lets you quickly and easily convert 3D files from one format to another. Build unique 3D document rendering solutions independently with the .NET API without requiring additional 3D rendering or modeling software."

<p>You can create 3D scenes from scratch with the help of the 3D API for .NET. Use the advanced features for 3D scene creation and manipulation in C# to enhance the 3D manipulation solutions. The below-given steps and information explain how to develop 3D scene maker solutions by creating a simple 3D scene on the .NET platform.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Initialize an object of the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed/scene/">Scene</a> class.</li>
   <li>Call the <strong>CreateChildNode()</strong> method to add some geometry/shape. For example, a Cylinder.</li>
   <li>Apply child node properties such as Material.</li>
   <li>Create an instance of the <strong>Light</strong> class.</li>
   <li>Add Light entity by calling <strong>CreateChildNode()</strong> method.</li>
   <li>Save the scene as FBX using the <strong>Save</strong> method, by adding the resultant file path and FileFormat.FBX7500ASCII as arguments.</li>
</ul>

// This code example demonstrates how to create a simple 3D scene in FBX file.
// Initialize 3D scene
var scene = new Scene();

// Initialize Cylinder object
var cylinder = new Cylinder();
cylinder.Name = "Cylinder";

// Create a child node and add Cylinder object
var node = scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode(cylinder);

// Set child node properites
var material = new LambertMaterial() { DiffuseColor = new Vector3(Color.LightBlue) };
material.Name = "Lambert";
node.Material = material;

// Add Light entity
var light = new Light() { LightType = LightType.Point };
light.Name = "Light";
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode(light).Transform.Translation = new Vector3(10, 0, 10);

// Output file path
var output = @"C:\Files\3D\document.fbx";

// Save 3D scene document
scene.Save(output, FileFormat.FBX7500ASCII);

<p>File conversion is one of the most common requirements for document processing solution makers. Automating the operation of converting files to and from different formats helps increase workflow efficiency. With the 3D file format conversion API, you can convert 3D files between various file formats. The process is simple, and it only takes a few lines of C# coding to convert FBX to STL, two of the most popular 3D file formats. Please check the following steps and information for converting Autodesk to 3D Systems CAD format.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Create an instance of the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed/scene/">Scene</a> class and load the source FBX file.</li>
   <li>Initialize the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/stlsaveoptions/">StlSaveOptions</a> class object.</li>
   <li>Use the <strong>Save</strong> method to convert the FBX file to STL format. Add the output file path and StlSaveOptions as arguments</li>
</ul>
{{< products/product-feature-blocks-snip
snipclass="greysnipp"
copyID="snipp3"
>}}
// Load the input FBX file using the Scene class
Scene document = new Scene("test.fbx");
// Create an instance of STLSaveOptions class 
STLSaveOptions options = new STLSaveOptions();

// Convert FBX to STL file 
document.Save("test_output.stl", options);
