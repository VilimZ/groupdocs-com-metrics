<p>Optical character recognition for scanned PDF documents is made simple with the help of Aspose.OCR for .NET. It is one of the most well-liked features of the .NET PDF document OCR API and equips anyone working with the API with all the required tools to recognize, extract, and convert text from PDF documents to multiple formats. Letâ€™s take a look at the steps needed to perform OCR on PDF documents and convert the extracted text from PDF to Word format:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Instantiate the <strong>AsposeOcr</strong> class.</a></li>
   <li>Create an object of the <strong>DocumentRecognitionSettings</strong> class.</li>
   <li>Specify the OCR language.</li>
   <li>Call the <strong>RecognizePdf()</strong> method to get <strong>RecognitionResult</strong>. Add file path and <strong>DocumentRecognitionSettings</strong> object as arguments.</li>
   <li>Save the text using the <strong>SaveMultipageDocument()</strong> method. Add the output file path, the <strong>SaveFormat</strong>, and <strong>RecognitionResult</strong> objects as arguments</li>
</ul>

// This code example demonstrates how to OCR PDF documents and save the recognized text as DOCX.
// Initialize the PCR engine
AsposeOcr recognitionEngine = new AsposeOcr();
// Initialize recognition settings
DocumentRecognitionSettings recognitionSettings = new DocumentRecognitionSettings();
// Specify language for OCR. Multi-language by default
recognitionSettings.Language = Language.Eng;
// Recognize text from PDF
List<RecognitionResult> results = recognitionEngine.RecognizePdf("C:\\MyFiles\\test.pdf", recognitionSettings);

// Save the recognized text as Word (DOCX) file
AsposeOcr.SaveMultipageDocument("C:\\Files\\OCR_result.docx", SaveFormat.Docx, results);

<p>The high-performance .NET OCR API allows developers to extract searchable text from scanned images and photos of different commonly-used image formats such as GIF, PNG, JPG, BMP, and TIFF. If you are looking to integrate OCR capabilities into your .NET apps, the image to text conversion feature could bolster them. Here, we will review the steps required for efficiently converting JPG to PDF using the robust OCR API for .NET:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Set input image file path for text recognition.</li>
   <li>Create an <strong>AsposeOcr</strong> class instance</li>
   <li>Use the <strong>RecognizeImage</strong> method to recognize text in your selected image file.</li>
   <li>Save the processed file using the <strong>Save</strong> method, and add the output file name and the <strong>SaveFormat</strong> as arguments.</li>
   <li>Ensure setting the resultant file to a searchable PDF document using <strong>SaveFormat</strong>.</li>
</ul>

// Set path for input image to recognize
string image = "OCR_test.jpg";
// Initialize AsposeOcr class instance
AsposeOcr api = new AsposeOcr();
// Recognize input image with RecognizeImage method
RecognitionResult result = api.RecognizeImage(image, new RecognitionSettings());
// Save output to searchable PDF file
result.Save("OCR_output.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf);
