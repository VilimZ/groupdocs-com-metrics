<p>The .NET barcode API supports generating QR codes with different types of encoding. You can add this functionality to your barcode manipulation applications and further enhance your offerings. Please check the following information and C# coding to quickly and easily generate QR codes using Aspose.BarCode for .NET library:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Instantiate the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/barcode/net/aspose.barcode.generation/barcodegenerator">BarcodeGenerator</a> class and specify the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/barcode/net/aspose.barcode.generation/encodetypes">EncodeType</a> and the input text.</li>
   <li>Set the QR code version and encoding type.</li>
   <li>Generate and save the QR Code image in PNG format.</li>
</ul>
{{< products/product-feature-blocks-snip

// Initialize an instance of BarcodeGenerator class
BarcodeGenerator gen = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.QR, "Aspose");
gen.Parameters.Barcode.XDimension.Pixels = 4;
// Set Auto version
gen.Parameters.Barcode.QR.QrVersion = QRVersion.Auto;
//Set ForceMicroQR QR encode type
gen.Parameters.Barcode.QR.QrEncodeType = QREncodeType.ForceMicroQR;
gen.Save(dataDir + "QREncodeTypeForceMicroQR.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
