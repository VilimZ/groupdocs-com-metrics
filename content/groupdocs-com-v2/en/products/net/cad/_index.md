   subtitle="Optimize AutoCAD File Processing and Conversion in .NET"
   subtext="Aspose.CAD for .NET is a high-performance API to render, manipulate, and convert CAD and BIM files. This .NET AutoCAD API includes features that enable developers to work with different elements of the CAD drawings. Loaded with excellent CAD file conversion capabilities, Aspose.CAD for .NET allows converting AutoCAD files to multiple formats, such as DWG to PDF, DWG to JPEG, DXF to PDF, and many more. You can optimize the AutoCAD processing workflow using the .NET API and integrate the immaculate rendering abilities into your document processing apps in .NET."
   subtext2="The .NET AutoCAD processing and conversion API offers enhanced memory management and multi-thread file processing. That makes it easy to convert or export files in bulk instead of working on one file at a time. The conversion process is fully customizable and supports tracking the file conversion with the ability to cancel the conversion if needed. It supports multiple OS, development environments, and frameworks offering a cross-platform AutoCAD file conversion experience like no other."

<p>You can build feature-rich CAD converter applications on the .NET platform using the .NET AutoCAD API. Converting DWG to PDF, DWF to PDF, DGN to PDF, or DXF to PDF is simple and easy. You can apply advanced settings to the output files during the conversion process. Letâ€™s check the following steps and sample code that highlight the conversion of DWF to PDF in .NET.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Add and Load the source DWF file in the <a href="https://apireference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad/image">Image</a> class object.</li>
   <li>Create an instance of the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.imageoptions/cadrasterizationoptions/">CadRasterizationOptions</a> class.</li>
   <li>Set the output PDF file page size.</li>
   <li>Initialize the PdfOptions class object.</li>
   <li>Set vectorization options using the VectorRasterizationOptions property.</li>
   <li>Save the output PDF file using the Save method and the PdfOptions object.</li>
</ul>
{{< products/product-feature-blocks-snip

// Load the DWF file in the Image class object
using (Image image = Image.Load("sample.dwf"))
{
	// Instantiate CadRasterizationOptions class object
	CadRasterizationOptions dwfRasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();

        // Set page size
        dwfRasterizationOptions.PageHeight = 500;
        dwfRasterizationOptions.PageWidth = 500;

        // Initialize PdfOptions object
        PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();

        // Set vector rasterization options
        pdfOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = dwfRasterizationOptions;

        // Save PDF file
        image.Save("output.pdf", pdfOptions);

<p>The .NET AutoCAD processing API lets users seamlessly convert CAD drawings to raster images. Different AutoCAD file formats could be programmatically rendered and converted to JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP, TIFF, and WEBP images within your .NET apps using the .NET AutoCAD conversion API. The information and code snippet shared below show how to convert DWG to JPEG in .NET.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Add the source DWG to the <a href="https://apireference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad/image">Image</a> class object.</li>
   <li>Set rasterization options for the desired JPEG file.</li>
   <li>Set the output page size.</li>
   <li>Apply the background color.</li>
   <li>Use the VectorRasterizationOptions property to set the rasterization options.</li>
   <li>Save the converted DWG to JPEG image using the Save method.</li>
</ul>

//Load the DWG to export to JPEG 
            using (Aspose.CAD.Image image = Aspose.CAD.Image.Load("test.dwg"))
