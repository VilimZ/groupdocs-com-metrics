   subtitle="Master Compression and Archiving on The .NET Platform"
   subtext="Aspose.ZIP for .NET is a feature-rich, standalone file compression, decompression, archiving, and encryption API. Developers can use the .NET API to compress files and folders to create archives of ZIP, RAR, 7ZIP, TAR, GZIP, CAB, BZ2, CPIO, LZ, and more types. It allows developers to manipulate the archives and supports adding or removing files to and from existing archives and inserting files without compression into the archives. The .NET compression library also includes powerful security features and enables securing the archives with the help of custom passwords, ZIPCrypto, and EAS encryption (AES128, AES192, and AES256) standards."
   subtext2="The file compression API for .NET supports extracting archive entries and creating self-extracting archives as part of its comprehensive feature set. Users can build extensive .NET solutions targeting desktop and web interfaces that can run on multiple OS or platforms with Aspose.ZIP for .NET. It does not require installing additional software to function, and it helps developers independently master document compression and archiving within their .NET apps."

<p>ZIP archives are one of the most common archive types, used globally to compress files and folders. ZIP archives are popular among users of different OS and platforms, placing them in a select group of universally accepted compression and archiving formats. Developers can efficiently create ZIP archives by adding more than one file within their C# .NET apps. In this coding example, we will review how to compress files in C# .NET using the .NET ZIP API by <a href="https://blog.aspose.com/zip/create-zip-archives-add-files-or-folders-to-zip-in-csharp-asp.net/#c-zip-multiple-files-using-filestream">archiving multiple files</a>. Let's check out the following steps and information for more.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Create a <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/zip/net/aspose.zip.archive/createentry/methods/1">FileStream</a> class object for the output ZIP archive.</li>

   <li>Create an <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/zip/net/aspose.zip/archive">Archive</a> class object.</li>
   <li>Add the source files into the archive using <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/zip/net/aspose.zip.archive/createentry/methods/1">Archive.CreateEntry(string, FileStream)</a> method.</li>
   <li>Use the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/zip/net/aspose.zip/archive/save/">Archive.Save(FileStream)</a> method to create the ZIP archive.</li>

<p>Converting archives of different types from one format to another is supported by the .NET archive creating and extraction library. The following code example explains how developers can convert a RAR file to ZIP format within their .NET apps. Letâ€™s review the steps involved in the <a href="https://blog.aspose.com/zip/convert-rar-files-to-zip-in-csharp/">conversion process</a>.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Create an <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/zip/net/aspose.zip/archive">Archive</a> class object for the ZIP archive.</li>
   <li>Using the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/zip/net/aspose.zip.rar/rararchive">RarArchive</a> class, load the RAR archive.</li>
   <li>Use the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/zip/net/aspose.zip.rar/rararchive/properties/entries">RarArchive.Entries</a> collection to loop through the entries of the RAR archive.</li>
   <li>For each entry in the RAR archive, extract the entry to the MemorySteam object using the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/zip/net/aspose.zip.rar/rararchiveentry/methods/extract">RarArchive.Entries[int].Extract(MemoryStream)</a> method. And add the entry to the ZIP archive using <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/zip/net/aspose.zip.archive/createentry/methods/1">Archive.CreateEntry(String, MemoryStream)</a> method.</li>
   <li>Save the output ZIP archive using the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/zip/net/aspose.zip/archive/methods/save">Archive.Save(String)</a> method.</li>
</ul>
